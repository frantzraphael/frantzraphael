# 👋 Hey, I'm Raphael Frantz

I'm a Front-End Developer who lived some back-end experiences. Currently living in Lisbon 🇵🇹

---

### 🧭 What I do

- Work on **enterprise systems** (CTRM, insurance, e-commerce, telecom campaigns…)
- Build **framework-level components**, design systems, modular front-end architecture
- Deal daily with **RxJS**, **Ag-Grid**, large forms, dynamic UIs, **state management**
- Optimize performance and scalability

Right now I'm working at **COFCO International**, on a CTRM platform used globally across different currencies, time zones, UoMs, and operations. It’s a beast. A beautiful beast.

### 🎨 Creative Stuff Too

I also like to think about visuals, interaction and usability.  
My Behance has some old UI explorations, branding exercises and prototypes:

Not a “designer designer”, but I care deeply about the experience.
